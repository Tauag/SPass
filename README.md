Do you want cryptographically strong passwords for your applications/accounts/anything you want? Then
never fear as SPass is here! SPass leverages the built in secrets library and over 7776 words to randomly
generate passphrases or even passwords. It even calculates the entropy for you.**

**It calculates the entropy of passwords, however at this point in time it only calculates the minimum entropy
of passphrases as well as a deviation. So for passphrases the true value is (entropy +- deviation)
